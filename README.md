# Cheat-sheet
Generates cheat-sheets in word documents with words in two languages (that would be usefull if i still had languages to learn for school)

This program takes input.txt file, where word list is created by the user, and converts it to a comfortable format to hold in the hand.

format in which user is asked to input the wordlist is: "word=word[enter]"

Program processes this input.txt file and outputs text.docx file with formatted text inside tables to be easily cut out.
